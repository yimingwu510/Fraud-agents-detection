# Fraud-agents-detection

Backgroud:

We propose a two-stage detection model to address the challenge of limited number of labeled fraud agent examples.

The first stage focusing on agent detection from all borrowers, and the second stage conducting the final fraud-agent detection from the agents detected in the first stage.
